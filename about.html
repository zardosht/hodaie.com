	<h1>Hi, </h1>

	<p>welcome to my homepage. I am Zardosht Hodaie. I come from Iran and currently live in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, Germany. I came to Germany at October 2006, and have got my bachelor and master degree in computer science in Technical University of Munich (<a href="http://www.in.tum.de/">TUM</a>). </p>

	<p>I knew that I want to study computer science from the time I got my first PC. It was a 286 with a 12 MHz CPU, 1 MB of RAM, and 40 MB of hard disk (I regret that I don't have a picture of it). I still can remember the first GWBASIC program that drew a curve of stars on the screen. I still remember pressing F2 to run your program, and the moment I got the first mysterious "divide overflow" error :). Nevertheless, it also happened that I got a bachelors in agricultural machinery in between (don't ask me how, it's a long story :D). I intent to continue my studies towards a Ph.D in computer science. </p>

	<p>Here I write about my experiences about software development and research. Also you will find here ideas for projects, sometimes ambitious visions, and my views on what I see around me.</p>

	<p> I like programming for two reasons: First, you start with nothing, you code, you compile and run, and voil√†... there is something. This feeling of creating something is so amazing and exciting. But there begins the second adventure.  Now it is no more the problem, but the computer itself that challenges you. This fellow machine does not alway want to accept that you are the boss. But at the end you always win. And the harder the problem, the more joyful is the moment that you win. It is a great moment. It's a moment of ecstasy. During my years of work, I have more and more learned to respect the complexity of creating software. As the great <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a> says: "Software is hard". And that's exactly why it is so fascinating. </p>
	
	<p>Beside computers, I also like music, specially <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SfHU0IFoP8">classical music</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oQ5ROZC4Yc#t=250">karate</a>, and reading books. </p>
