I have recently discovered this amazing indie rock singer. Her music, singing technique, and lyrics are fabulous. Just by random surfing I read a news about her having a concert in Montreal's Jazz Festival. A youtube search and the first song I heard was The Limit to Your Love. Well, we have love at first sight, but this time was love at first hearing :D. Try it yourself.

I heard all her songs after wards. Her new album [Metals](http://www.listentofeist.com/) is different from her previous albums, and in my opinion the most beautiful. My all time favorite is [Undiscovered First](http://open.spotify.com/track/0GgpECgIWMkvtJEwaAIER9) ( read the lyrics [here](http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107858882900/)).
