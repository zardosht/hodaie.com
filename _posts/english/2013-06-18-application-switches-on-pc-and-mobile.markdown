Comparison of context switches (application switches) on PC and on Mobile. 

Questions:  
1. average number of context switches on each platform (H0: number of context switches are higher on mobile than on PC) 
2. Category of applications in context switches (H0: context switches on PC happen more between applications that are related (for example belong to the same category?), and on the mobile are more scattered around categories)
