Classification of issue reports into bug report or feature request.

More than 30 percent of the bug reports are feature requests ==> Automatically detecting if it is bug or a feature request. 

1. user just sees a simple text field where he describes what is the problem.
2. system automatically decides if it is a bug report, or feature request, and also its priority, and even maybe the assignee... etc.
