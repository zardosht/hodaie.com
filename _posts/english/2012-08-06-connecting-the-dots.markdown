I so much liked the idea of [connecting the dots](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA).

In fact it has happened many times to all of us, and will also happen a lot more in the future. We never know when and where will that seeming meaningless thing that we learned one day, that apparently waste of time, come to help us. But it will. Staying awake late in the night to understand and fix a rather unimportant problem, might seem stupid at first. But what you learn from it is priceless at a moment in future.
