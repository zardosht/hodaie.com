We are moving from conflict of formats to the era of conflict of services. The companies are making services attractive to users so that the buy their hardware an platform which works good (nearly perfect) with the service. However a services is a universal concept from point of view of user. For example having a todo, communicating via email, having calendar, and the desire to integrate all of them. These are services, and they are universal - independent of the platform. All users like to have them. 

But why we have different companies that offer these universal services in their specific platform and optimize it so much that the users must buy their platform to enjoy the service. Because the companies want to make money. The iCloud services are hardly compatible with Google services and can hardly be integrated. For example I cannot use the iCloud ToDos and use Google Calendar (integrated) together the way that I could use iCloud ToDos and iCloud Calendar together. It would be of course desirable to mix these services, no matter who is the provider. But if so, then the users where no more bound to the platform. They could choose if they want to buy a Mac or a PC, an Android or an iPhone.
