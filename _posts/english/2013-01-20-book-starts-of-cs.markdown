A problem that I have encountered in computer science faculties, both at TUM and University of Hamburg, is that the students don't know a lot about the history of computer science. In fact many of them are not even interested in knowing this history. Generally I see a lack of enthusiasm in many CS students. 

To solve it, I thought if they know great people in their field, and know what they have contributed, they might be more interested. So the idea of a book about stars of computer science: people like Don Knuth, John Mc Carthy, Grace Hopper, ....

The book contains their short biography, their major contributions, images of where and how they work, anecdotes about them, famous quotes of them, and so on. The purpose is more to attract new CS students. 

Good print on good paper, images, etc... Two pages (left-right) for each person. About 100 persons. Selection of them can be challenging.... we need to first define some criteria. Second, ask other people, for example professors and professional for who they would like to see in this list. The winners of Turing Award is also a good source. But it should not be limited to it.
